# About KinTree

This repository contains the codebase for the KinTree project. This project stems from the CSE 3213/3223 Software Engineering Senior Project I/II course sequence at Mississippi State University.

KinTree is an application that allows users to connect with family members and build virtual, visualized, and dynamic family trees collaboratively. This project began in the Fall of 2024 and is ongoing. KinTree will utilize React, Node.js, and MySQL.

The current KinTree project team as of Fall 2024 includes Owen Adams, Kennedi James, Destiny Milsap, and Jade Thompson. The primary stakeholder for this project is Dr. Charan Gudla.

# Install

### Prerequisites

Node.js (install the correct version for your own OS [here](https://nodejs.org/en))

### Setup

To set up the KinTree codebase on your own machine, start by cloning the repository to your local file system.

From the command line, navigate to the project's main directory, then run the following command:

`npm install`

This command will install dependencies that are listed in the project's package.json file. Note that you must have npm (Node Package Manager) installed and working on your computer for this command to work. The npm command line interface should come with a standard Node.js installation.

Once those dependencies are installed, navigate to the /SeniorProject_RelateMe/client directory, and run `npm install` once more.

Once all dependencies are installed, you can run the project (from the /SeniorProject_RelateMe/client directory) by running the following command:

`npm start`

This command runs the application in development mode. You can open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application. Any changes made to the source code will cause the application page to refresh and show reflected changes (once the changed file is saved).

You can run the server/API by running the following command in the main directory (/SeniorProject_RelateMe):

`node server.js`
